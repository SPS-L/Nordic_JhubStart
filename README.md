# Start-up material for PyRAMSES on JupyterHub

If you have JupyterLab installed with [pyramses](https://sps.cut.ac.cy/pyramses) then these data will get you started on running some basic dynamic simulations on Nordic test system.

Simply load the folder in JupyterHub and open the Execute notebook. Run the cells and watch a beautiful voltage collapse scenario, as described [here](https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/245565).
